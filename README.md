L2 Databases Project - RATP Line 7 Paris subway ðŸš‰
___________________________________________________
The goal of this project was to create a database structure on the line 7 of RATP subway.

1. First, we created the entities-relational (E-R) data model on Looping.
2. Then, we deduce the logical model from the E-R model respecting the normalization.
3. Using DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language), we create the data base on MySQL WorkBrench using SQL. Moreover, we added constraints with DCL.
4. Tanks to SQL (DQL), queries allow us to extract specific informations from the entities, combining logical and creative reasonning.
